Required Plugins:

- Surge XT 

- Surge XT Effects




Notes:

- The FilterBass patch was originall quite detuned and I retuned it by ear. 
  ToDo: Tune it properly and exactly. Maybe use a pitch detector plugin for that. Play a somwhat 
  higher note and then use the "Pitch" slider in Surge
  ...Im currently at around -0.5 semitones...but it's rough
  
- Check, if all plugins correctly receive the sample rate from he host. Maybe some plugin think 
  they are running at 44.1 and others at 48? That would explain the detuning
